<h1>🎓 Student Performance Predictor</h1>
A beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts students' final exam scores based on key academic and lifestyle factors using Python.

<h2>🔍 Overview</h2>
This project uses a small, custom-built dataset to train a Linear Regression model. The goal is to predict student performance based on:

<b>📚 Study Hours </b>

<b>📈 Attendance Percentage</b>

<b>😴 Sleep Hours</b>

<b>📊 Past Scores</b>

<b>💬 Class Participation</b>

🚀 Technologies Used
Python

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

numpy

📊 Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² Score

Visual comparison of actual vs predicted scores

📈 Visualization
A bar chart visually shows the difference between real and predicted scores for test data.


💡 What I Learned
How to structure a dataset

How to apply regression modeling using scikit-learn

Basics of evaluating model performance

How to visualize results with matplotlib

✅ Future Improvements
Expand dataset for better accuracy

Use more advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)

Create a user interface for inputs and predictions

🧠 Try It Yourself!
Clone the repo, run the script, and tweak the dataset to see how predictions change.
