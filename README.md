<h1>🎓 Student Performance Predictor</h1>
A beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts students' final exam scores based on key academic and lifestyle factors using Python.

<h2>🔍 Overview</h2>
This project uses a small, custom-built dataset to train a Linear Regression model. The goal is to predict student performance based on:

<b>📚 Study Hours </b>

<b>📈 Attendance Percentage</b>

<b>😴 Sleep Hours</b>

<b>📊 Past Scores</b>

<b>💬 Class Participation</b>

<h2>🚀 Technologies Used
Python</h2>

<b>pandas</b>

<b>scikit-learn</b>

<b>matplotlib</b>

<b>numpy</b>

<h2>📊 Model Evaluation</h2>
The model was evaluated using:

<b>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</b>

<b>R² Score</b>

<b>Visual comparison of actual vs predicted scores</b>

<h2>📈 Visualization</h2>
A bar chart visually shows the difference between real and predicted scores for test data.


<h2>💡 What I Learned</h2>
<b>How to structure a dataset</b>

<b>How to apply regression modeling using scikit-learn</b>

<b>Basics of evaluating model performance</b>

<b>How to visualize results with matplotlib</b>

<h2>✅ Future Improvements</h2>
<b>Expand dataset for better accuracy</b>

<b>Use more advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)</b>

<b>Create a user interface for inputs and predictions</b>

<h2>🧠 Try It Yourself!</h2>
Clone the repo, run the script, and tweak the dataset to see how predictions change.
